# vancouverGo
A list of companies in Vancouver that are using Go.

# Submissions
To submit please open a pull request or send me a tweet (twitter.com/callumstyan) with the following info:

- Company name and what your product is/the company does
- size of the company in general, number of people in Vancouver, number of teams/engineers in Vancouver that use Go
- what the teams that use Go do? backend/web, open source, systems level programming, etc.

The idea is to get a sense of whether or not Go is widely used within your organization, or just used by a small handful of developers.

I'm not opposed to including remote friendly companies that have a Go developers in Vancouver who either meet and work in person regularly, or share a coworking space together.
